# 🌟 Hey there, I'm Sumit Kumawat 🦇  

⚡ Turning ☕ + 💻 into **AI wizardry, Web wonders & Hackathon adventures** ✨  

I love building things that *wow people* – from AI-driven apps to sleek websites, and yes... winning hackathons along the way 🏆.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new ideas, working on projects, or leveling up my Data Science + ML skills 📊🤖.
